Maybe use Mo[ou]seX::Object::Pluggable, MooseX::Role::Pluggable?

This is sort of a plan of whats to come...

Conform::Queue - job queue object, we should have a wax on and wax off (rollback) queue
Conform::Queue::Base - basic queue functions

Conform::Role::Action - base for actions, roles are good
Conform::Action::* - all the actions, like File_install and stuff
Conform::Primitive::* - maybe, put primitive functions in here? So actions are just a thin later between the queue and primitives? maybe this is better as Conform::Utils?

Conform::PluginBase - maybe,base for plugins
Conform::Plugin::* - maybe,plugins

These need  _____/ Conform::Registrar - where actions register themselves
some thought     \ Conform::Dispatcher - maybe, runs the queue?

Conform::Log - what its name implies

Conform::IdentifyHardware - Maybe this should be Conform::Discovery::Hardware and Conform::Discovery::Other

There is definitely a difference between lower level primitive functions and higher level functions. The division is quite clear though im not sure how we should best provide a framework for the two.

The first, is functions like File_install => [], which provide a discrete work unit with in each key value pair. Basically each time the key occurs, then function can be safely run with the arguments attached.

Perhaps we should call these actions?

The second, is functions like Httpd => {}, which are called with i_isa_fetchall or i_isa_merge. We need to run the handler for this only once, and after we are sure no more Httpd => {} stanzas will be added.

Perhaps we should call these plugins modules?

Another thought, perhaps the loading and handling of one off primitives should be provided by a 'plugin'. Then there is no special case, every plugin is pushed on to the queue. This really needs more thought ;)
