 - Runtime plugin filtering
    - plugins should be able to specify versions and types of
      runtimes they support
 - Runtime auto detection
 - Logging vs Debug
 - Logger - check that log4perl delegate has the correct caller_depth
 - Configuration File Loading
 - Safe mode
 - Task directives - where to wedge them in?
    - Probably the best solution is to have the site
      filter and process these.
      E.g. :Task => { Foo => { ":directive" => value, :arg = bar' }
        would expand to 'Foo' => 'bar',
      And :Task => { Bar => { ":arg" => { } }
        would expand to 'Bar' => { }
      etc...
 - Conditional work queue
    - :if directive
 - Ensure directive in Tasks and Actions to preempt the scheduler
 - Unschedule directive int Tasks and Actions to remove tasks from the work queue
 - Server Component
 - Dependency/Require checks w/actions
 - 3rd party plugins
 - 3rd party runtimes
 - Documentation
 - More Documentation
 - Even More Documentaton
 - Ditto for unit tests
