This is sort of a plan of whats to come...

Conform::Queue - job queue object, we should have a wax on and wax off (rollback) queue
Conform::Queue::Base - basic queue functions

Conform::Role::Action - base for actions, roles are good
Conform::Action::* - all the actions, like File_install and stuff
Conform::Task::* - something that runs once, that typically creates a bunch of Action's

Conform::Runtime - where stuff happens

Conform::Logger - what its name implies

Conform::IdentifyHardware - Maybe this should be Conform::Discovery::Hardware and Conform::Discovery::Other
